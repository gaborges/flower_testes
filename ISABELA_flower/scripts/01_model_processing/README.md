# Model processing folder

This folder has the scripts that process the data and generates the results.

It was three files:
- **MLP_didatic_federated_example.ipynb**: it has a code with a basic the Multi-layer Perceptron to a classification problem.
- **RNN_LSTM_didatic_federated_example.ipynb**: it has a code of time sequence classification with Long short-term memory algorithm.
- **federated_learning_for_image_classification.ipynb**: it has the example from Google with image processing.

Execute jupyter notebook and you will be able to read and execute the files.

Summary of the commands:
- (if you are using conda) `conda activate trctf`
- `jupyter notebook`

It is recommended to access read the comments and execute until the end all files in the follow order: 
1. **MLP_didatic_federated_example.ipynb**,
2. **RNN_LSTM_didatic_federated_example.ipynb**
3. **federated_learning_for_image_classification.ipynb**
